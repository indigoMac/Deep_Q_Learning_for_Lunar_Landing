# Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Landing

This project demonstrates how to use Deep Q-Learning to solve the Lunar Lander problem, a classic control problem in reinforcement learning. The code is implemented in Python using the Gymnasium library for the environment and PyTorch for building the neural network.

## Key Features
- Implementation of the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.
- Training and evaluation of the model in the Lunar Lander environment.
- Visualization of the results and the agent's performance.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the required packages. You can do this directly in your Jupyter Notebook or Colab environment.

```bash
!pip install gymnasium torch numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Deep_Q_Learning_for_Lunar_Landing.git
   cd Deep_Q_Learning_for_Lunar_Landing
   ```
2. Open the Colab File:
  Upload the Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Landing.ipynb file to your Google Drive and open it with Google Colab.
3. Run the Notebook:
   Follow the steps in the notebook to install dependencies, set up the environment, define the neural network, train the model, and evaluate the results.
